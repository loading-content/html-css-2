      <h2>this is my epic game made in javascipt. </h2>
      <p>i made this game in a week, but the hours i spent on it were about 6 hours maximum. 1-2 hours were spent on the basic stuff of the game and the rest of the time was spent on colors, the death screen and the score display</p>
      <h3>there is 2 versions: </h3>
      <p>1. a smaller one that is meant for phone but phones dont process things the same as laptop so its really laggy.
      the controls are also different in that its just clicking/tapping. </p>
      <p>2. and the version is a bigger one that is meant for laptop.
        it works fine but if you have a good laptop/pc it will be really fast and basically impossible.
      the controls are just pressing space and when you die you have to press enter to restart</p>
      <p>of the 2 versions this is the 1st because its smaller.
        if you want to play the other version just scroll down a bit to the words "game but bigger". </p>
      <p>i could make a start sceen but i dont care enough and this is good enough for me.</p>

      <h2>something about python</h2>
      <img id="python" src="photos/python.jpg" alt="python program">
      <p>here is a picture of a python program i made for python 3 (coding module)</p>
      <p>i dont remember how long it took but this was also made fairly quickly</p>
      <p>it started with checking out what other people made. i saw this random persons dictionary and was like this is my idea now. after a little while and some stuggles this came out of it and im pretty happy with how it looks. </p>
      <p>you can find the program on my github below</p>

      <h2>something with c#</h2>
      <p>this is just some c# stuff i did i dont know what to really say about it. </p>
      <p>this is the thing that has the most lines of code. </p>
      <p>it asks what you want to buy and how many and does that 3 times after which it tells you how much it costs with btw being 21%. </p>
